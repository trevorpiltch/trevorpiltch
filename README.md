I'm a second year Software Engineering (co-op) student at McGill University in Montreal. I started learning to code by writing iOS apps (and released my own!) but since then, I've gotten more interested in low-level programming and server systems. Below you can find some useful links, my published work, and some projects I'm working on. <br/> <br/>
I was appointed Flight Computer Software Lead by the McGill Rocket Team and it's by far my proudest work of code.  The codebase is written in C and C++ for the STM32 microcontroller. The flight computer hardware is also entirely student created, and includes different sensors for temperature, pressure, acceleration, and magnetic orientation. The software system takes all these inputs (through the I2C protocal) and manages the flight trajectory of the rocket. Some things I've done since joining the team: <br/> 
1. Converted the loop based application structure to a concurrent environment using RTOS <br/>
2. Fixed an I2C data loss bug <br/>
3. Refactored and tested an SD Card driver with the FatFS library <br/> <br/>
Outside of computers, I love reading, skateboarding, and running. I'm a lifelong learner and I'm always looking for a new challenge. Check out my work and projects below! <br/>
