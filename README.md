I'm in my third year studying Software Engineering (B.Eng, Co-op) at McGill University in Montreal. Outside of academics and software, I spend my time running, skateboarding, and reading old science fiction novels. I also listen to a lot of 80s synth pop and am always looking for new music suggestions.
