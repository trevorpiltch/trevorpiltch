I'm a freshman at McGill University in Montreal studying Software Engineering. I mainly write iOS & MacOS apps, but I've also worked with classical and quantum algorithms. I build websites, web apps, and bare metal software. Outside of computers, I love to skateboard, surf, and play soccer. I am a very organized person and I think the answer to everything is Don't Panic (😉).
